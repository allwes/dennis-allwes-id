      I am a Data Scientist with approximately 3 years of experience. I am
      currently interested in computer vision, especially research about
      computer vision. My goal is to make a program that can translate Western
      musical notation into numerical music notation commonly found in
      Indonesia.

      As a data scientist and computer vision researcher focusing on Optical
      Music Recognition &#40;OMR&#41;, I utilize various tools to support my
      work. In data processing, I often use Python alongside libraries such as
      OpenCV for image manipulation, NumPy for numerical data processing, and
      Pandas for data analysis. I rely on frameworks such as TensorFlow and
      Keras to build machine learning models, especially in developing CRNN
      &#40;Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network&#41; architecture that can
      recognise patterns in music images. In the data annotation task, I used
      LabelImg to create bounding boxes compatible with formats such as
      PascalVOC or YOLO to support object detection and segmentation in music
      data.

      I often use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to present insights
      interactively and aesthetically for data visualisation. Kaggle and Jupyter
      Notebook are frequently used to integrate data analysis, visualisation,
      and documentation directly. In addition, I also applied data augmentation
      techniques to expand the dataset and improve the model&#39;s
      generalizability. Combining these tools allows me to design innovative and
      effective solutions in OMR research.

      I have organisational experience in the Gita Dian Nuswa Choir, where I
      served as General Chairperson for one year after being active in the
      Rehearsal Division. In this role, I learned to work in teams, manage human
      resources to improve efficiency, and design and execute various events,
      including preparations for international competitions. This experience
      strengthened my leadership skills and provided valuable insights into
      coordinating different aspects of an organisation to achieve a common
      goal. That I Implement at Allwess as an Operational Director
